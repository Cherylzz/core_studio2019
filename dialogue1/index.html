    <div class="L2">"Okay..."</div>

    <div class="L4">"I asked you to clean up your room." </div>   
    <div class="L5">"I did."</div> 
    <div class="L6">"Well...why haven’t you changed your bed sheets. Why is your blanket hanging on the side touching the carpet, and also you haven’t vacuum your carpet. You did not empty your trash can. Paints are all over your desk, you think your desk is a color palette or what? Hang your pile of clothes up, it’s going to get wrinkly. By the way, close the closet door when you are done hanging the clothes, so you don’t hit your feet again. Most importantly, clean off the dust on the edges of your windows for good Feng Shui."</div>
